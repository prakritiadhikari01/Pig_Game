# 🎲 Pig Game

A fun, console-based dice game for 2-4 players built with Python. The objective is simple—be the first player to score 50 or more points!

   - If you choose to **hold**, the points you've earned in the current turn are added to your total score.
3. The first player to reach **50 points** wins the game.
